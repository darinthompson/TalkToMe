# TalkToMe
Full Sail University Capstone Project

TalkToMe is a personal journal and self-help companion powered by OpenAI. Designed to provide thoughtful prompts, emotional check-ins, and reflective conversations, this app helps users process their thoughts, track their mental well-being, and build healthier habits. While not a replacement for professional therapy, it serves as a supportive daily aid for mindfulness, self-awareness, and emotional growth.
